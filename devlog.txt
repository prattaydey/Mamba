Uno Card Game

/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
- Got our ANSII implementation for each card ToString to work. Now, our cards are printed with their respective colors.
- "Remix" method that takes into account when all cards in the deck are used up.
- Fixed isValid method to take into account when the game has just started, and any card is valid to put down as the initial card in the pile.
- Fixed Bot method that kept drawing cards from the deck multiple times within one turn.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Still need to implement the game running file.
- Have to review Iterator, will likely use to go through each player's turns.
- Still need to adjust game to take user input
- Still need to implement functionality for skip, reverse, and other special cards.
- When a Player draws a card and it is valid, will it be automatically put onto the pile, or will it be up to the player's decision?
- java.util.ConcurrentModificationException

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- If you're using ANSII colors and you don't want the whole terminal to change colors, there is a specific code to reset the color to its original state.

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- At the start of the game, a random card is played from the deck, rather than the stack being empty as it would give advantage to the first player of the game.
- Instead of using Iterator, we chose to do simpler for loops.
- Might use deques to hold Participants rather than ArrayList

LESSONS LEARNED
- Trace.
- Plan.
- Consult resources like Java API.
- Always have resources at hand. 
- Communicate at all times.
